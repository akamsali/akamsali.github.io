Hello ! I am a 2nd year PhD student in ECE at Purdue, WL. I am currently working in the intersection of Computational Neuroscience and AI with [Dr. Joe Makin](https://engineering.purdue.edu/MakinLab/people/ptProfile?resource_id=242786&group_id=242782&photo=right), where I use deep learning to decode speech and motion from neural data from human subjects and monkeys. 

Previously, I was working with [Dr. Naresh Emani](https://people.iith.ac.in/nke/) at Nanophotonics Lab, IITH, where I studied carrier dynamics in GaAs using FLIM and COMSOL simulations. 

You can find my CV [here](../assets/pdf/Akshita_Kamsali_CV.pdf).
