*Actively seeking Internship opportunities for Summer/Fall 2026!*

I am a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University and a member of the [Robot Vision Lab](https://engineering.purdue.edu/RVL/), advised by [Dr. Avi Kak](https://engineering.purdue.edu/kak/). My research is in deep learning, focusing on interpretabilty solutions for deep learning models. I have had the opportunity to work with various industry collaborators for real-life problem solving throughout my PhD. Proficient in Python, PyTorch, and Deep Learning, I also bring strong skills in scientific communication, public speaking, and presentations, enabling me to effectively bridge research and impactful real-world applications.

I have also interned at [Lawrence Livermore National Lab](https://www.llnl.gov/), was a **Top-presenter** featured in [LLNL newsletter](https://www.llnl.gov/article/53246/meet-llnl-three-interns-what-makes-lab-special) and [Purdue ECE top news](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE/News/2025/purdue-ece-phd-student-accelerates-ai-research-at-lawrence-livermore-national-laboratory).

For a detailed overview of my academic and professional journey, you can view my [resume](../assets/pdf/Kamsali_Resume.pdf).
