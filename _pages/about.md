Hello ! I am a 2nd year PhD student in ECE at Purdue University. I am a member of the [Robot Vision Lab](https://engineering.purdue.edu/RVL/), advised by [Dr. Avi Kak](https://engineering.purdue.edu/kak/). My research interests are using deep learning for image segmentation and object tracking in various applications like satellite images and biological tissue samples.

Previously, I worked in the intersection of Computational Neuroscience and AI with [Dr. Joe Makin](https://engineering.purdue.edu/MakinLab/people/ptProfile?resource_id=242786&group_id=242782&photo=right), where I use deep learning and machine learning to decode speech and motion from neural data from human subjects and monkeys. 

In another life, my research was in the area of Nanophotonics and Electrodynamics. My work involved computational modelling and simulating systems at nano-scale in both solid state and biological samples.

You can find my full CV [here](../assets/pdf/Akshita_Kamsali_CV.pdf) and the one page version [here](../assets/pdf/Akshita_Kamsali_Resume.pdf).
