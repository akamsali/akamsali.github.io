I am a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University and a member of the [Robot Vision Lab](https://engineering.purdue.edu/RVL/), advised by [Dr. Avi Kak](https://engineering.purdue.edu/kak/). My research is in deep learning, focusing on interpretabilty solutions for deep learning models. I have had the opportunity to work with various industry collaborators for real-life problem solving throughout my PhD. Proficient in Python, PyTorch, and Deep Learning, I also bring strong skills in scientific communication, public speaking, and presentations, enabling me to effectively bridge research and impactful real-world applications.

I have also interned at [Lawrence Livermore National Lab](https://www.llnl.gov/), was a **Top-presenter** featured in [LLNL newsletter](https://www.llnl.gov/article/53246/meet-llnl-three-interns-what-makes-lab-special) and [Purdue ECE top news](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE/News/2025/purdue-ece-phd-student-accelerates-ai-research-at-lawrence-livermore-national-laboratory).

Previously, I contributed to research at the intersection of Computational Neuroscience and AI with [Dr. Joe Makin](https://engineering.purdue.edu/MakinLab). My work involved applying machine learning and deep learning techniques to decode speech and motion from neural data captured from both human and primate subjects.

In an earlier phase of my career, I explored the fascinating field of Nanophotonics and Electrodynamics, where I combined computational modeling with experimental research. My projects focused on simulating nanoscale systems in solid-state and biological contexts, as well as designing and fabricating nanostructures for applications in sensing and imaging. I am deeply grateful to have been mentored by the remarkable [Dr. Naresh Emani](https://people.iith.ac.in/nke/#about), [Dr. Jinal Tapar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jinal-tapar-ab3a54123/) and [Dr. Zubin Jacob](https://electrodynamics.org/zjacob) whose guidance has profoundly shaped my academic and professional journey. Their expertise and support have inspired my passion for research and continue to influence my approach to problem-solving and innovation.
