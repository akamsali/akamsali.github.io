  abstract={The realization of low threshold, room temperature operation of semiconductor NIR nanolasers is still a challenge. Large surface-to-volume ratio of the nanostructures aggravates surface recombination leading to non-radiative decay of excited carriers. P-doping of active material is a viable solution to bring down the lasing threshold without surface passivation. Here, we report an improved quantum yield of p-doped GaAs over intrinsic, with the help of carrier lifetime measurement using FLIM system. We aim to study how the onset of the Auger process affects the PL and carrier lifetime at higher pump fluence.},
