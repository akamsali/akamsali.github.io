Hello ! I am a 2nd year PhD student in ECE at Purdue, WL. I am member of the [Robot Vision Lab](https://engineering.purdue.edu/RVL/). My research interests are using deep learning for image segmentation and tracking in various applications ranging satellite images to tissue samples. 
Previously, I worked in in the intersection of Computational Neuroscience and AI with [Dr. Joe Makin](https://engineering.purdue.edu/MakinLab/people/ptProfile?resource_id=242786&group_id=242782&photo=right), where I use deep learning and machine learning to decode speech and motion from neural data from human subjects and monkeys. 

Before moving to ML, I was working in the area of Nanophotonics and Electrodynamics. I was very fortunate to be mentored by [Dr. Zubin Jacob](https://electrodynamics.org/) and [Dr. Naresh Emani](https://people.iith.ac.in/nke/) during my pursuit of engineering physics. 

You can find my CV [here](../assets/pdf/Akshita_Kamsali_CV.pdf).
