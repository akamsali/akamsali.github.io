Hello ! I am a 3rd year PhD student in ECE at Purdue University. I am a member of the [Robot Vision Lab](https://engineering.purdue.edu/RVL/), advised by [Dr. Avi Kak](https://engineering.purdue.edu/kak/). My primary research interests lie in the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision. I specialize in leveraging deep learning techniques to enhance multi-modal performance at an academic scale

Previously, I worked in the intersection of Computational Neuroscience and AI with [Dr. Joe Makin](https://engineering.purdue.edu/MakinLab/people/ptProfile?resource_id=242786&group_id=242782&photo=right), where I use deep learning and machine learning to decode speech and motion from neural data from human subjects and monkeys. 

In another life, my research was in the area of Nanophotonics and Electrodynamics. My work involved computational modelling and simulating systems at nano-scale in both solid state and biological samples.

You can find my full CV [here](../assets/pdf/Akshita_Kamsali_CV.pdf) and the one page version [here](../assets/pdf/Akshita_Kamsali_Resume.pdf).
