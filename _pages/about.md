I am a PhD candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University, where I am a proud member of the [Robot Vision Lab](https://engineering.purdue.edu/RVL/), under the guidance of [Dr. Avi Kak](https://engineering.purdue.edu/kak/). My research lies at the exciting intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), focusing on the development of machine learning solutions to understand multimodal data for change detection and anomaly detection.

I have a strong foundation in both theoretical and applied machine learning and am passionate about exploring how AI can unlock insights across diverse domains.

Previously, I contributed to research at the intersection of Computational Neuroscience and AI with [Dr. Joe Makin](https://engineering.purdue.edu/MakinLab/people/ptProfile?resource_id=242786&group_id=242782&photo=right). My work involved applying machine learning and deep learning techniques to decode speech and motion from neural data captured from both human and primate subjects.

In an earlier phase of my career, I explored the fascinating field of Nanophotonics and Electrodynamics, where I combined computational modeling with experimental research. My projects focused on simulating nanoscale systems in solid-state and biological contexts, as well as designing and fabricating nanostructures for applications in sensing and imaging. I am deeply grateful to have been mentored by the remarkable [Dr. Naresh Emani](https://people.iith.ac.in/nke/#about), [Dr. Jinal Tapar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jinal-tapar-ab3a54123/) and [Dr. Zubin Jacob](https://electrodynamics.org/zjacob) whose guidance has profoundly shaped my academic and professional journey. Their expertise and support have inspired my passion for research and continue to influence my approach to problem-solving and innovation.
