I am a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University and a member of the [Robot Vision Lab](https://engineering.purdue.edu/RVL/), under the guidance of [Dr. Avi Kak](https://engineering.purdue.edu/kak/). My research lies at the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), focusing on machine learning solutions for multimodal data analysis, with expertise in [LLM evaluation, knowledge graph generation, inference, and anomaly detection](https://akamsali.github.io/projects/4_project/) **[NeurIPS'24]**. Proficient in Python, PyTorch, and Deep Learning, I also bring strong skills in scientific communication, public speaking, and presentations, enabling me to effectively bridge research and impactful real-world applications.

I have also interned at [Lawrence Livermore National Lab](https://www.llnl.gov/) and I was featured in [LLNL newsletter](https://www.llnl.gov/article/53246/meet-llnl-three-interns-what-makes-lab-special) and [Purdue ECE top news](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE/News/2025/purdue-ece-phd-student-accelerates-ai-research-at-lawrence-livermore-national-laboratory). 

For a detailed overview of my academic and professional journey, you can view my full [CV](../assets/pdf/Akshita_Kamsali_CV.pdf) or my condensed [resume](../assets/pdf/Kamsali_Resume.pdf).
